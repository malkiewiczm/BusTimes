This aggregates the bus schedules using a small parser written in lex.

Compile with "make all", run with "make run" -- see makefile for
details.

List of schedule commands:

ROUTE -- sets the route number

SET IN -- sets times to inbound side

SET OUT -- sets times to outbound side

SET ALTERNATE IN/OUT -- alternates the sides, starting immediately
with IN or OUT (whichever is specified)

AM -- sets times to morning

PM -- sets times to evening (the only thing this changes is that it
adds +12 to the hour)

Look at the supplied routes for more details / examples.
